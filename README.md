# DA Project.Finding a best strategy for Fitness gyms by using ML skills.

## Overview
*One of the most common problems that gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do you know when a client is no longer with you? How do you predict the likelihood of churn (for the next month) for each client?

Using Python and machine learning skills I was able to: Predict the probability of churn (for the next month) for each client.
Draw up portraits of typical users: identify the most prominent groups and describe their main characteristics.
Analyze the factors that most influence the churn.
Draw key conclusions and develop recommendations to improve customer service:
Identify target groups;
Suggest measures to reduce customer churn.

Type of ML model: Model Random Forest Classified.
